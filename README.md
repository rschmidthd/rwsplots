This repository contains code used to generate plots in my papers.

The jupyter files will produce the plots:

talk_hannover.ipynb:
* Gregorian lunar calendar
* computation of lunar months
* diagram for the celestial sphere
* diagram for the Kepler orbit and the equation of the centre
* comparison equation of centre: Kepler vs modern values
